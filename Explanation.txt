Running the simulation:
	sim.txt is what the simulation runs off of. The first line must be the pricerate and timerate,but after that order doesn't matter.
	Format:
		PRICERATE TIMERATE
		Driver name bal rating [x y]
		Client name bal [x y]
		Request clientname [x y]
	
	input.txt By default this is where the simulation gets its user input from. Takes "y" or "n" as driver responses to 
	ride request, rating 0.0 to 5.0 for client rating of driver. The program will disregard invalid input so it 
	should always work as long as each request has enough "n"'s for every driver or has a "y" followed by a rating.
	Format:
		y
		n
		rating
	
	Output given by simulation is stored in log.txt in the resources folder, along with final state information in finalOutput.txt.
	
	In order to switch input and output to the console a few lines of code need to be commented/uncommented.
	Instructions provided within uberSimulation.java.



UberEats Reusability:
	In order to implement uberEats from my version of uber only 3 simple
	functions would need to be added and 2 existing print statements
	would have to be updated. First, the client would need a requestMeal function
	that would pass the location of the restaurant as well as their order.
	This would be sent to the Manager's receiveRequest function just like a normal 
	ride. In order for this to work, the Ride class would need another constructor 
	that is passed the location of the restaurant(in place of the client's
	destination) as well as an the client's order. This constructor would simply set
	the pickup location to the restraunt's location and the final destination to the 
	client's location, having the driver go pickup the food and bring it to the Client.
	Assuming that the driver is just calling in the order at the restaurant, ride 
	would also have a getOrder function to allow the driver to see what to order.
	With these new functions in place the Driver's request handling function as well as 
	the Manager's checkRides function(that updates user's on their order's status) would
	need to be updated to print different information for uberEats.
